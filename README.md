## 1. Describing the Problem
This is a problem of Pssr this mean that I have  to define  a set of variables, set of constraints, define the domain that can be assigned to each variable and then implement the backtrack/bakcjump algorigthm to find the solution.
I have to find a way that can help "Universidad Catolica" to organize his speakers for his event, to do that they give us the category of each conference that is:
    - Informatic Security
    - Software Enginering
    - Artificial intelligence
Also they give us a set of constraint for each speaker, and the date and hour and duration of each conference

## 2. Describing the Solution
For solving the problem i define:
    - Set Variables: Each timetable in the total of duration off the event.
    - Set of domain: The domains are the speaker.
